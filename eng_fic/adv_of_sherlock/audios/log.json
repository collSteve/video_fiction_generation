{"paragraphs": ["CHAPTER I", "To Sherlock Holmes she is always the woman. I have seldom heard him mention her under any other name. In his eyes she eclipses and predominates the whole of her sex. It was not that he felt any emotion akin to love for Irene Adler. All emotions, and that oneparticularly, were abhorrent to his cold, precise but admirablybalanced mind. He was, I take it, the most perfect reasoning andobserving machine that the world has seen, but as a lover he wouldhave placed himself in a false position. He never spoke of the softerpassions, save with a gibe and a sneer. They were admirable thingsfor the observer--excellent for drawing the veil from men's motivesand actions. But for the trained reasoner to admit such intrusionsinto his own delicate and finely adjusted temperament was tointroduce a distracting factor which might throw a doubt upon all hismental results. Grit in a sensitive instrument, or a crack in one ofhis own high-power lenses, would not be more disturbing than a strongemotion in a nature such as his. And yet there was but one woman tohim, and that woman was the late Irene Adler, of dubious andquestionable memory.", "I had seen little of Holmes lately. My marriage had drifted us awayfrom each other. My own complete happiness, and the home-centredinterests which rise up around the man who first finds himself masterof his own establishment, were sufficient to absorb all my attention,while Holmes, who loathed every form of society with his wholeBohemian soul, remained in our lodgings in Baker Street, buried amonghis old books, and alternating from week to week between cocaine andambition, the drowsiness of the drug, and the fierce energy of hisown keen nature. He was still, as ever, deeply attracted by the studyof crime, and occupied his immense faculties and extraordinary powersof observation in following out those clues, and clearing up thosemysteries which had been abandoned as hopeless by the officialpolice. From time to time I heard some vague account of his doings:of his summons to Odessa in the case of the Trepoff murder, of hisclearing up of the singular tragedy of the Atkinson brothers atTrincomalee, and finally of the mission which he had accomplished sodelicately and successfully for the reigning family of Holland.Beyond these signs of his activity, however, which I merely sharedwith all the readers of the daily press, I knew little of my formerfriend and companion.", "One night--it was on the twentieth of March, 1888--I was returningfrom a journey to a patient (for I had now returned to civilpractice), when my way led me through Baker Street. As I passed thewell-remembered door, which must always be associated in my mind withmy wooing, and with the dark incidents of the Study in Scarlet, I wasseized with a keen desire to see Holmes again, and to know how he wasemploying his extraordinary powers. His rooms were brilliantly lit,and, even as I looked up, I saw his tall, spare figure pass twice ina dark silhouette against the blind. He was pacing the room swiftly,eagerly, with his head sunk upon his chest and his hands claspedbehind him. To me, who knew his every mood and habit, his attitudeand manner told their own story. He was at work again. He had risenout of his drug-created dreams and was hot upon the scent of some newproblem. I rang the bell and was shown up to the chamber which hadformerly been in part my own.", "His manner was not effusive. It seldom was; but he was glad, I think,to see me. With hardly a word spoken, but with a kindly eye, he wavedme to an armchair, threw across his case of cigars, and indicated aspirit case and a gasogene in the corner. Then he stood before thefire and looked me over in his singular introspective fashion.", "\"Wedlock suits you,\" he remarked. \"I think, Watson, that you have puton seven and a half pounds since I saw you.\"", "\"Seven!\" I answered.", "\"Indeed, I should have thought a little more. Just a trifle more, Ifancy, Watson. And in practice again, I observe. You did not tell methat you intended to go into harness.\"", "\"Then, how do you know?\"", "\"I see it, I deduce it. How do I know that you have been gettingyourself very wet lately, and that you have a most clumsy andcareless servant girl?\"", "\"My dear Holmes,\" said I, \"this is too much. You would certainly havebeen burned, had you lived a few centuries ago. It is true that I hada country walk on Thursday and came home in a dreadful mess, but as Ihave changed my clothes I can't imagine how you deduce it. As to MaryJane, she is incorrigible, and my wife has given her notice, butthere, again, I fail to see how you work it out.\"", "He chuckled to himself and rubbed his long, nervous hands together.", "\"It is simplicity itself,\" said he; \"my eyes tell me that on theinside of your left shoe, just where the firelight strikes it, theleather is scored by six almost parallel cuts. Obviously they havebeen caused by someone who has very carelessly scraped round theedges of the sole in order to remove crusted mud from it. Hence, yousee, my double deduction that you had been out in vile weather, andthat you had a particularly malignant boot-slitting specimen of theLondon slavey. As to your practice, if a gentleman walks into myrooms smelling of iodoform, with a black mark of nitrate of silverupon his right forefinger, and a bulge on the right side of histop-hat to show where he has secreted his stethoscope, I must bedull, indeed, if I do not pronounce him to be an active member of themedical profession.\"", "I could not help laughing at the ease with which he explained hisprocess of deduction. \"When I hear you give your reasons,\" Iremarked, \"the thing always appears to me to be so ridiculouslysimple that I could easily do it myself, though at each successiveinstance of your reasoning I am baffled until you explain yourprocess. And yet I believe that my eyes are as good as yours.\"", "\"Quite so,\" he answered, lighting a cigarette, and throwing himselfdown into an armchair. \"You see, but you do not observe. Thedistinction is clear. For example, you have frequently seen the stepswhich lead up from the hall to this room.\"", "\"Frequently.\"", "\"How often?\"", "\"Well, some hundreds of times.\"", "\"Then how many are there?\"", "\"How many? I don't know.\"", "\"Quite so! You have not observed. And yet you have seen. That is justmy point. Now, I know that there are seventeen steps, because I haveboth seen and observed. By-the-way, since you are interested in theselittle problems, and since you are good enough to chronicle one ortwo of my trifling experiences, you may be interested in this.\" Hethrew over a sheet of thick, pink-tinted note-paper which had beenlying open upon the table. \"It came by the last post,\" said he. \"Readit aloud.\"", "The note was undated, and without either signature or address.", "\"There will call upon you to-night, at a quarter to eight o'clock,\"it said, \"a gentleman who desires to consult you upon a matter of thevery deepest moment. Your recent services to one of the royal housesof Europe have shown that you are one who may safely be trusted withmatters which are of an importance which can hardly be exaggerated.This account of you we have from all quarters received. Be in yourchamber then at that hour, and do not take it amiss if your visitorwear a mask.\"", "\"This is indeed a mystery,\" I remarked. \"What do you imagine that itmeans?\"", "\"I have no data yet. It is a capital mistake to theorize before onehas data. Insensibly one begins to twist facts to suit theories,instead of theories to suit facts. But the note itself. What do youdeduce from it?\"", "I carefully examined the writing, and the paper upon which it waswritten.", "\"The man who wrote it was presumably well to do,\" I remarked,endeavouring to imitate my companion's processes. \"Such paper couldnot be bought under half a crown a packet. It is peculiarly strongand stiff.\"", "\"Peculiar--that is the very word,\" said Holmes. \"It is not an Englishpaper at all. Hold it up to the light.\"", "I did so, and saw a large \"E\" with a small \"g,\" a \"P,\" and a large\"G\" with a small \"t\" woven into the texture of the paper.", "\"What do you make of that?\" asked Holmes.", "\"The name of the maker, no doubt; or his monogram, rather.\"", "\"Not at all. The 'G' with the small 't' stands for 'Gesellschaft,'which is the German for 'Company.' It is a customary contraction likeour 'Co.' 'P,' of course, stands for 'Papier.' Now for the 'Eg.' Letus glance at our Continental Gazetteer.\" He took down a heavy brownvolume from his shelves. \"Eglow, Eglonitz--here we are, Egria. It isin a German-speaking country--in Bohemia, not far from Carlsbad.'Remarkable as being the scene of the death of Wallenstein, and forits numerous glass-factories and paper-mills.' Ha, ha, my boy, whatdo you make of that?\" His eyes sparkled, and he sent up a great bluetriumphant cloud from his cigarette.", "\"The paper was made in Bohemia,\" I said.", "\"Precisely. And the man who wrote the note is a German. Do you notethe peculiar construction of the sentence--'This account of you wehave from all quarters received.' A Frenchman or Russian could nothave written that. It is the German who is so uncourteous to hisverbs. It only remains, therefore, to discover what is wanted by thisGerman who writes upon Bohemian paper and prefers wearing a mask toshowing his face. And here he comes, if I am not mistaken, to resolveall our doubts.\"", "As he spoke there was the sharp sound of horses' hoofs and gratingwheels against the curb, followed by a sharp pull at the bell. Holmeswhistled.", "\"A pair, by the sound,\" said he. \"Yes,\" he continued, glancing out ofthe window. \"A nice little brougham and a pair of beauties. A hundredand fifty guineas apiece. There's money in this case, Watson, ifthere is nothing else.\"", "\"I think that I had better go, Holmes.\"", "\"Not a bit, Doctor. Stay where you are. I am lost without my Boswell.And this promises to be interesting. It would be a pity to miss it.\"", "\"But your client--\"", "\"Never mind him. I may want your help, and so may he. Here he comes.Sit down in that armchair, Doctor, and give us your best attention.\"", "A slow and heavy step, which had been heard upon the stairs and inthe passage, paused immediately outside the door. Then there was aloud and authoritative tap.", "\"Come in!\" said Holmes.", "A man entered who could hardly have been less than six feet sixinches in height, with the chest and limbs of a Hercules. His dresswas rich with a richness which would, in England, be looked upon asakin to bad taste. Heavy bands of astrakhan were slashed across thesleeves and fronts of his double-breasted coat, while the deep bluecloak which was thrown over his shoulders was lined withflame-coloured silk and secured at the neck with a brooch whichconsisted of a single flaming beryl. Boots which extended halfway uphis calves, and which were trimmed at the tops with rich brown fur,completed the impression of barbaric opulence which was suggested byhis whole appearance. He carried a broad-brimmed hat in his hand,while he wore across the upper part of his face, extending down pastthe cheekbones, a black vizard mask, which he had apparently adjustedthat very moment, for his hand was still raised to it as he entered.From the lower part of the face he appeared to be a man of strongcharacter, with a thick, hanging lip, and a long, straight chinsuggestive of resolution pushed to the length of obstinacy.", "\"You had my note?\" he asked with a deep harsh voice and a stronglymarked German accent. \"I told you that I would call.\" He looked fromone to the other of us, as if uncertain which to address.", "\"Pray take a seat,\" said Holmes. \"This is my friend and colleague,Dr. Watson, who is occasionally good enough to help me in my cases.Whom have I the honour to address?\"", "\"You may address me as the Count Von Kramm, a Bohemian nobleman. Iunderstand that this gentleman, your friend, is a man of honour anddiscretion, whom I may trust with a matter of the most extremeimportance. If not, I should much prefer to communicate with youalone.\"", "I rose to go, but Holmes caught me by the wrist and pushed me backinto my chair. \"It is both, or none,\" said he. \"You may say beforethis gentleman anything which you may say to me.\"", "The Count shrugged his broad shoulders. \"Then I must begin,\" said he,\"by binding you both to absolute secrecy for two years; at the end ofthat time the matter will be of no importance. At present it is nottoo much to say that it is of such weight it may have an influenceupon European history.\"", "\"I promise,\" said Holmes.", "\"And I.\"", "\"You will excuse this mask,\" continued our strange visitor. \"Theaugust person who employs me wishes his agent to be unknown to you,and I may confess at once that the title by which I have just calledmyself is not exactly my own.\"", "\"I was aware of it,\" said Holmes dryly.", "\"The circumstances are of great delicacy, and every precaution has tobe taken to quench what might grow to be an immense scandal andseriously compromise one of the reigning families of Europe. To speakplainly, the matter implicates the great House of Ormstein,hereditary kings of Bohemia.\"", "\"I was also aware of that,\" murmured Holmes, settling himself down inhis armchair and closing his eyes.", "Our visitor glanced with some apparent surprise at the languid,lounging figure of the man who had been no doubt depicted to him asthe most incisive reasoner and most energetic agent in Europe. Holmesslowly reopened his eyes and looked impatiently at his giganticclient.", "\"If your Majesty would condescend to state your case,\" he remarked,\"I should be better able to advise you.\"", "The man sprang from his chair and paced up and down the room inuncontrollable agitation. Then, with a gesture of desperation, hetore the mask from his face and hurled it upon the ground. \"You areright,\" he cried; \"I am the King. Why should I attempt to concealit?\"", "\"Why, indeed?\" murmured Holmes. \"Your Majesty had not spoken before Iwas aware that I was addressing Wilhelm Gottsreich Sigismond vonOrmstein, Grand Duke of Cassel-Felstein, and hereditary King ofBohemia.\"", "\"But you can understand,\" said our strange visitor, sitting down oncemore and passing his hand over his high white forehead, \"you canunderstand that I am not accustomed to doing such business in my ownperson. Yet the matter was so delicate that I could not confide it toan agent without putting myself in his power. I have come incognitofrom Prague for the purpose of consulting you.\"", "\"Then, pray consult,\" said Holmes, shutting his eyes once more.", "\"The facts are briefly these: Some five years ago, during a lengthyvisit to Warsaw, I made the acquaintance of the well-knownadventuress, Irene Adler. The name is no doubt familiar to you.\"", "\"Kindly look her up in my index, Doctor,\" murmured Holmes withoutopening his eyes. For many years he had adopted a system of docketingall paragraphs concerning men and things, so that it was difficult toname a subject or a person on which he could not at once furnishinformation. In this case I found her biography sandwiched in betweenthat of a Hebrew rabbi and that of a staff-commander who had writtena monograph upon the deep-sea fishes.", "\"Let me see!\" said Holmes. \"Hum! Born in New Jersey in the year 1858.Contralto--hum! La Scala, hum! Prima donna Imperial Opera ofWarsaw--yes! Retired from operatic stage--ha! Living in London--quiteso! Your Majesty, as I understand, became entangled with this youngperson, wrote her some compromising letters, and is now desirous ofgetting those letters back.\"", "\"Precisely so. But how--\"", "\"Was there a secret marriage?\"", "\"None.\"", "\"No legal papers or certificates?\"", "\"None.\"", "\"Then I fail to follow your Majesty. If this young person shouldproduce her letters for blackmailing or other purposes, how is she toprove their authenticity?\"", "\"There is the writing.\"", "\"Pooh, pooh! Forgery.\"", "\"My private note-paper.\"", "\"Stolen.\"", "\"My own seal.\"", "\"Imitated.\"", "\"My photograph.\"", "\"Bought.\"", "\"We were both in the photograph.\"", "\"Oh, dear! That is very bad! Your Majesty has indeed committed anindiscretion.\"", "\"I was mad--insane.\"", "\"You have compromised yourself seriously.\"", "\"I was only Crown Prince then. I was young. I am but thirty now.\"", "\"It must be recovered.\"", "\"We have tried and failed.\"", "\"Your Majesty must pay. It must be bought.\"", "\"She will not sell.\"", "\"Stolen, then.\"", "\"Five attempts have been made. Twice burglars in my pay ransacked herhouse. Once we diverted her luggage when she travelled. Twice she hasbeen waylaid. There has been no result.\"", "\"No sign of it?\"", "\"Absolutely none.\"", "Holmes laughed. \"It is quite a pretty little problem,\" said he.", "\"But a very serious one to me,\" returned the King reproachfully.", "\"Very, indeed. And what does she propose to do with the photograph?\"", "\"To ruin me.\"", "\"But how?\"", "\"I am about to be married.\"", "\"So I have heard.\"", "\"To Clotilde Lothman von Saxe-Meningen, second daughter of the Kingof Scandinavia. You may know the strict principles of her family. Sheis herself the very soul of delicacy. A shadow of a doubt as to myconduct would bring the matter to an end.\"", "\"And Irene Adler?\"", "\"Threatens to send them the photograph. And she will do it. I knowthat she will do it. You do not know her, but she has a soul ofsteel. She has the face of the most beautiful of women, and the mindof the most resolute of men. Rather than I should marry anotherwoman, there are no lengths to which she would not go--none.\"", "\"You are sure that she has not sent it yet?\"", "\"I am sure.\"", "\"And why?\"", "\"Because she has said that she would send it on the day when thebetrothal was publicly proclaimed. That will be next Monday.\"", "\"Oh, then we have three days yet,\" said Holmes with a yawn. \"That isvery fortunate, as I have one or two matters of importance to lookinto just at present. Your Majesty will, of course, stay in Londonfor the present?\"", "\"Certainly. You will find me at the Langham under the name of theCount Von Kramm.\"", "\"Then I shall drop you a line to let you know how we progress.\"", "\"Pray do so. I shall be all anxiety.\"", "\"Then, as to money?\"", "\"You have carte blanche.\"", "\"Absolutely?\"", "\"I tell you that I would give one of the provinces of my kingdom tohave that photograph.\"", "\"And for present expenses?\"", "The King took a heavy chamois leather bag from under his cloak andlaid it on the table.", "\"There are three hundred pounds in gold and seven hundred in notes,\"he said.", "Holmes scribbled a receipt upon a sheet of his note-book and handedit to him.", "\"And Mademoiselle's address?\" he asked.", "\"Is Briony Lodge, Serpentine Avenue, St. John's Wood.\"", "Holmes took a note of it. \"One other question,\" said he. \"Was thephotograph a cabinet?\"", "\"It was.\"", "\"Then, good-night, your Majesty, and I trust that we shall soon havesome good news for you. And good-night, Watson,\" he added, as thewheels of the royal brougham rolled down the street. \"If you will begood enough to call to-morrow afternoon at three o'clock I shouldlike to chat this little matter over with you.\""], "tts_errors": [], "speaker": "Royston Min", "language": "en", "output_file": "audios/ch1", "segment_files": {"0": "audios/ch1_0.mp3", "1": "audios/ch1_1.mp3", "2": "audios/ch1_2.mp3", "3": "audios/ch1_3.mp3", "4": "audios/ch1_4.mp3", "5": "audios/ch1_5.mp3", "6": "audios/ch1_6.mp3", "7": "audios/ch1_7.mp3", "8": "audios/ch1_8.mp3", "9": "audios/ch1_9.mp3", "10": "audios/ch1_10.mp3", "11": "audios/ch1_11.mp3", "12": "audios/ch1_12.mp3", "13": "audios/ch1_13.mp3", "14": "audios/ch1_14.mp3", "15": "audios/ch1_15.mp3", "16": "audios/ch1_16.mp3", "17": "audios/ch1_17.mp3", "18": "audios/ch1_18.mp3", "19": "audios/ch1_19.mp3", "20": "audios/ch1_20.mp3", "21": "audios/ch1_21.mp3", "22": "audios/ch1_22.mp3", "23": "audios/ch1_23.mp3", "24": "audios/ch1_24.mp3", "25": "audios/ch1_25.mp3", "26": "audios/ch1_26.mp3", "27": "audios/ch1_27.mp3", "28": "audios/ch1_28.mp3", "29": "audios/ch1_29.mp3", "30": "audios/ch1_30.mp3", "31": "audios/ch1_31.mp3", "32": "audios/ch1_32.mp3", "33": "audios/ch1_33.mp3", "34": "audios/ch1_34.mp3", "35": "audios/ch1_35.mp3", "36": "audios/ch1_36.mp3", "37": "audios/ch1_37.mp3", "38": "audios/ch1_38.mp3", "39": "audios/ch1_39.mp3", "40": "audios/ch1_40.mp3", "41": "audios/ch1_41.mp3", "42": "audios/ch1_42.mp3", "43": "audios/ch1_43.mp3", "44": "audios/ch1_44.mp3", "45": "audios/ch1_45.mp3", "46": "audios/ch1_46.mp3", "47": "audios/ch1_47.mp3", "48": "audios/ch1_48.mp3", "49": "audios/ch1_49.mp3", "50": "audios/ch1_50.mp3", "51": "audios/ch1_51.mp3", "52": "audios/ch1_52.mp3", "53": "audios/ch1_53.mp3", "54": "audios/ch1_54.mp3", "55": "audios/ch1_55.mp3", "56": "audios/ch1_56.mp3", "57": "audios/ch1_57.mp3", "58": "audios/ch1_58.mp3", "59": "audios/ch1_59.mp3", "60": "audios/ch1_60.mp3", "61": "audios/ch1_61.mp3", "62": "audios/ch1_62.mp3", "63": "audios/ch1_63.mp3", "64": "audios/ch1_64.mp3", "65": "audios/ch1_65.mp3", "66": "audios/ch1_66.mp3", "67": "audios/ch1_67.mp3", "68": "audios/ch1_68.mp3", "69": "audios/ch1_69.mp3", "70": "audios/ch1_70.mp3", "71": "audios/ch1_71.mp3", "72": "audios/ch1_72.mp3", "73": "audios/ch1_73.mp3", "74": "audios/ch1_74.mp3", "75": "audios/ch1_75.mp3", "76": "audios/ch1_76.mp3", "77": "audios/ch1_77.mp3", "78": "audios/ch1_78.mp3", "79": "audios/ch1_79.mp3", "80": "audios/ch1_80.mp3", "81": "audios/ch1_81.mp3", "82": "audios/ch1_82.mp3", "83": "audios/ch1_83.mp3", "84": "audios/ch1_84.mp3", "85": "audios/ch1_85.mp3", "86": "audios/ch1_86.mp3", "87": "audios/ch1_87.mp3", "88": "audios/ch1_88.mp3", "89": "audios/ch1_89.mp3", "90": "audios/ch1_90.mp3", "91": "audios/ch1_91.mp3", "92": "audios/ch1_92.mp3", "93": "audios/ch1_93.mp3", "94": "audios/ch1_94.mp3", "95": "audios/ch1_95.mp3", "96": "audios/ch1_96.mp3", "97": "audios/ch1_97.mp3", "98": "audios/ch1_98.mp3", "99": "audios/ch1_99.mp3", "100": "audios/ch1_100.mp3", "101": "audios/ch1_101.mp3", "102": "audios/ch1_102.mp3", "103": "audios/ch1_103.mp3", "104": "audios/ch1_104.mp3", "105": "audios/ch1_105.mp3", "106": "audios/ch1_106.mp3", "107": "audios/ch1_107.mp3", "108": "audios/ch1_108.mp3", "109": "audios/ch1_109.mp3", "110": "audios/ch1_110.mp3", "111": "audios/ch1_111.mp3", "112": "audios/ch1_112.mp3", "113": "audios/ch1_113.mp3", "114": "audios/ch1_114.mp3", "115": "audios/ch1_115.mp3", "116": "audios/ch1_116.mp3", "117": "audios/ch1_117.mp3", "118": "audios/ch1_118.mp3", "119": "audios/ch1_119.mp3", "120": "audios/ch1_120.mp3"}}
